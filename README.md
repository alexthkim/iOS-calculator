#iOS Calculator Project

##Basic Information

Codebase taken from Stanford's CS193P Lecture Class.

I have created a basic calculator with a dozen or so functions for an iOS device. 
This is the first time I've developed an app using the MVC Object Oriented Design pattern.
I also learned about interacting with Swift's integration between UI and code.

##Specifics of the Project

I implemented several different parts of the working calculator:

1. **Top display** - Displays the answer to the previous operation used

2. **Bottom display** - Displays the history of a combination of digits and operation to get the output on the top display

3. **Digit buttons** - These correspond to the 0-9 numpad on the calculator and are used for processing information

4. **Operation buttons** - These correspond to the unary and binary mathematical functions that calculate answers 

5. **"." button** - Allows for input of decimal numbers

6. **"C" button** - Clears/resets the calculators history and output

Note: Swift's precision is a bit off so subtraction doesn't work as properly intended
